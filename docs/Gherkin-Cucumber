📌 Why we use Gherkin keywords (@Given, @When, @Then, @And)
👉 Big Picture (1–line summary)

Gherkin keywords help convert business-readable scenarios into executable automation steps by clearly separating setup, action, and validation.

🧩 Detailed Explanation (Comment Style – Copy-Paste Friendly)
/*
WHY WE USE GHERKIN KEYWORDS (Given / When / Then / And):

1. @Given
   - Used to define the PRE-CONDITION or initial state of the test.
   - Example: launching the application, navigating to login page.
   - It answers the question: "Where are we starting from?"

2. @When
   - Used to describe the USER ACTION or behavior.
   - Example: entering username/password, clicking login.
   - It answers the question: "What action is the user performing?"

3. @Then
   - Used for VERIFICATION or ASSERTION.
   - Example: validating products page or error message.
   - It answers the question: "What is the expected outcome?"

4. @And
   - Used to combine multiple steps of the SAME TYPE.
   - Helps improve readability and avoid repeating @When or @Then.
   - It does not change behavior, only improves clarity.

WHY THIS STRUCTURE IS IMPORTANT:
- Makes test cases readable by non-technical stakeholders.
- Keeps automation logic aligned with business scenarios.
- Improves reusability of steps across multiple scenarios.
- Helps in debugging because failures are clearly categorized.

🧠 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW ANSWER (MEMORISE THIS)

If interviewer asks:

❓ Why do you use Given, When, Then in Cucumber?

👉 Say this:

“Given defines the precondition, When defines the user action, and Then is used for validation.
This separation makes scenarios readable, reusable, and easy to maintain, and it aligns automation with business behavior.”

🔥 That is a senior-level answer.

❌ Common Mistake (Good to know)

❌ Putting assertions in @When
❌ Writing everything under @And
❌ Mixing setup and validation

✅ You are doing it correctly by:

Setup → Given

Action → When

Validation → Then

🎯 Final Tip (Very Practical)

Gherkin is not for automation engineers only — it is a communication tool between QA, Dev, and Business.

# =========================
# WHY WE USE GHERKIN KEYWORDS
# =========================
# Given  → Used to define the PRE-CONDITION of the test
#         (Example: user is on login page, application is launched)
#
# When   → Used to describe the USER ACTION
#         (Example: user enters username/password, clicks login)
#
# Then   → Used to VERIFY the expected result
#         (Example: products page is displayed, error message is shown)
#
# And    → Used to combine multiple steps of the SAME TYPE
#         Improves readability, does not change execution logic
#
# This structure makes test cases:
# - Easy to understand for non-technical stakeholders
# - Aligned with real user behavior
# - Reusable and maintainable in automation

✅ EXAMPLE FEATURE FILE WITH COMMENTS INCLUDED
# Feature file written using Gherkin syntax
# Gherkin helps convert business scenarios into executable tests

@Regression
Feature: SauceDemo Login

  # Given → application state
  # When  → user action
  # Then  → expected result

  @Smoke
  Scenario: Valid user should login successfully
    Given user is on SauceDemo login page
    When user enters valid username and password
    And clicks on login button
    Then Products page should be displayed

  @Negative
  Scenario: Invalid user should see the error message
    Given user is on SauceDemo login page
    When user enters invalid username and password
    And clicks on login button
    Then Error message should be displayed

🧠 INTERVIEW BONUS (VERY IMPORTANT)

If interviewer asks:

“Why do you use Given, When, Then?”

👉 You can confidently say:

“I use Given to define the precondition, When for user actions, and Then for validations.
This keeps scenarios readable, reusable, and aligned with business behavior.”
